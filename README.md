# Building

## Via flatpak (recommended)
The recommended way to build is using flatpak, which will take care of all dependencies and avoid any problems that may come from different system configurations.

If you don't have the flathub repo in your remote-list for flatpak you will need to add that first:
```shell
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Then install the required flatpak platform and SDK, if you dont have them already:
```shell
$ flatpak install org.gnome.{Platform,Sdk}//41 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable//21.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.llvm12//21.08
```

To compile and install as a flatpak, clone the project, change to the project directory, and run:
```shell
$ flatpak-builder --install flatpak-build/ build-aux/org.freedesktop.ryuukyu.Helvum.json
```

You can then run the app via
```shell
$ flatpak run org.freedesktop.ryuukyu.Helvum
```

## Manually
For compilation, you will need:

- Meson
- An up-to-date rust toolchain
- `libclang-3.7` or higher
- `gtk-4.0` and `pipewire-0.3` development headers

To compile and install, run

```shell
$ meson setup build && cd build
$ meson compile
$ meson install
```

in the repository root.
This will install the compiled project files into `/usr/local`.
